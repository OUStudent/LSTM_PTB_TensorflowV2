# LSTM_PTB_TensorflowV2

Here is the link to the Google Colab for my implementation for an LSTM in TensorflowV2 for PTB dataset:

Training, Validation, and Test data are all aviable here for reproducing. In addition, the `reader.py` data preprocessing file is also available. Will need to copy these files and script to the Google colab to replicate my results.
